            A woman accused Hegseth of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room in 2017, stating he took her phone and blocked the door so she couldn’t leave. Police reports exist; he denies wrongdoing.
            <br>Reporting from multiple outlets says he paid a financial settlement to resolve the matter, which he calls an attempt to avoid a frivolous lawsuit; he has not been criminally charged.
            <br>Ahead of his confirmation, Senator Elizabeth Warren and others flagged that his household held stock in multiple defense contractors while he resisted standard ethics commitments, raising concerns about profiting from companies he oversees(who doesn't like some spiiice in their corruption spagetti)
            
          </p>
          <h2>Seriously, WTF?</h2>
          <p>
            Hegseth has argued that U.S. troops shouldn’t be constrained by the Geneva Conventions and has publicly supported torture practices like waterboarding, positions described by experts as contrary to international law and U.S. obligations.
            <br>He has been a leading defender of service members accused of war crimes, such as former Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, and pushed for presidential interventions that critics say undermine military justice and accountability for war crimes.(taking back what I said, adding war crimes in the sauce is a fantastic idea)
            <br>Commentators describe his philosophy as a “who cares?” approach to the rules of war—openly skeptical of international humanitarian law and favoring unconstrained force. (A fox news reporter as the commander of the largest army on earth? painfully sublime.)
            <br>As Defense Secretary, Hegseth has defended a second U.S. airstrike on a Venezuelan or Caribbean “drug boat” that reportedly targeted unarmed survivors clinging to wreckage after the first attack.(et voilà)
