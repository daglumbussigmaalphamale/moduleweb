            A New York jury convicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, tied to reimbursements for a hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.
            <br>Two federal civil cases resulted in Trump being found liable for sexual abuse (battery) and defamation of writer E. Jean Carroll.
            <br>Juries awarded Carroll $5 million (2023) and then $83.3 million in a second defamation case in 2024; total damages about $88.3 million.
            <br>In the New York Attorney General’s case, a state court found Trump and his companies had for years submitted “blatantly false” financial statements that inflated his net worth to get better loan terms.
            <br>Two federal impeachments (not criminal convictions, but formal findings by the House)
