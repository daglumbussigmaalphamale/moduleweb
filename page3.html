            Reporting has highlighted suspiciously well-timed large crypto purchases shortly before major Trump policy announcements on a “crypto reserve,” raising questions (though not proven allegations) about insider knowledge or conflicts.
            <br>As senator and now vice president, Vance has kept significant financial interests in Narya Capital and other venture funds that invest in companies—including defense contractors—benefiting from Trump-administration policies and contracts. 
            <br>promoted a political project that stigmatizes divorce, single parenthood, and same-sex marriage, framed by critics as demeaning and discriminatory toward large groups of people.

          <h2>LOL</h2>
          <p>before becoming Trump’s running mate, Vance privately compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and called him “reprehensible” and an “idiot,” then later reinvented himself as one of Trump’s most devoted allies.
